\section{Signal K input streamer
usage}\label{signal-k-input-streamer-usage}}

    Those who are interested in how things works may want read some theory
from the \emph{Signal K input streamer design description} document
(\href{SignalKInputStreamer.ipynb}{ipynb} \textbar{}
\href{SignalKInputStreamer.html}{html} \textbar{}
\href{SignalKInputStreamer.pdf}{pdf}).

    If not, be still reminded that the Signal K input streamer of
\emph{DashT} plug-in is not needed to use OpenCPN with a Signal K server
together as explained below.

    \hypertarget{connecting-signal-k-node-server-and-opencpn-instances}{%
\subsection{Connecting Signal K node server and OpenCPN
instances}\label{connecting-signal-k-node-server-and-opencpn-instances}}

    There are many advantages to use a
\href{https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/master/README.md}{Signal
K node server} with OpenCPN. It enables your networked boat
instrumentation ecosystem where OpenCPN is an important player but not
the only one. With Signal K node server the various software and
hardware units gets all the same data, at the same time thanks to its
powerful interconnection capabilities.

    Since the \emph{DashT Signal K input streamer} does \textbf{not} feed
and will never feed data to OpenCPN it is necessary to provide OpenCPN
with its own Signal K connection:

    \begin{quote}
If you missed the theory part, be aware that not all NMEA sentences will
be served by Signal K input streamer but only those available in the
delta channel of the Signal K node server. For example, AIS data is not.
Even without AIS, OpenCPN needs its own GPS data. So, before setting the
by-pass one needs to feed the OpenCPN so that it works also without the
Signal K input streamer of the \emph{DashT} plug-in.
\end{quote}

    In this document we expect that the Signal K server node's input is from
USB as in the use case referred in above documents. Otherwise, it does
not matter what are its inputs. We have set Signal K's AIS-to-NMEA
forwarder plug-in output to \texttt{12000} (for no particular reason).

    If you are not familiar with Signal K, please follow the above link,
install a server and play around with it and its incorporated
instruments. Once get your data visible using your browser, you will be
familiar at this point with Signal K Server administration, which can be
accessed typically through this URL on the system where the Signal K
server node is running (or on a remote server on another computer using
its IP-address or its network name):

    \begin{quote}
\textbf{http://localhost:3000/admin/\#/dashboard}
\end{quote}

    \hypertarget{classical-tcp-settings}{%
\subsubsection{Classical TCP settings}\label{classical-tcp-settings}}

    These are explained better in various Signal K node server documents.
They results to following views, first on the Signal K server node's
server administration side\ldots{}

    \begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{signalkin-usbinputdevice.png}
\caption{signalkin-usbinputdevice.png}
\end{figure}

    For the AIS, it is a plug-in, which here we set to port 12000, for no
particular reason other than to have something to easy to remember.

\end{figure}

    \ldots{} and on the OpenCPN communication settings side:

    \begin{figure}

\includegraphics{signalkin-odataconfig.png}
\caption{signalkin-odataconfig.png}
\end{figure}

    \hypertarget{udp-broadcasting-method}{%
\subsubsection{UDP broadcasting method}\label{udp-broadcasting-method}}

    This is the alternative method for those having, for example multiple
OpenCPN or other software clients requesting NMEA sentences on diffent
computers. For example, one can have one OpenCPN in the Raspberry Pi or
other Linux box on which the Signal K node server is running. But one
may want to have an other OpenCPN instance on a laptop or tablet.

    With UDP broadcasting Signal K node server becomes the broadcaster of
the all data it receives while the listeners will be\ldots{} well,
listening! Very efficient but with a possibility of a data loss. But for
all practical terms, with these data rates that's not an issue.

    You need to install @signalk/udp-nmea-plugin, if not yet installed,

    \begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{signalkin_udp-nmea-plugin.png}
\caption{signalkin\_udp-nmea-plugin.png}
\end{figure}

    Configuration: provide your network's address as base to broadcast to.
255 is the broadcast address. Line delimiter is optional, if you want to
debug it simplifies your life. You can debug now, with (Linux) command
\texttt{nc\ -ulkw\ 0\ 192.168.8.255\ 2000} where you would replace
\texttt{192.168.8} with your network IP-address. Typically, in a local
system like Raspberry Pi, you would use the local network broadcast
addeess \texttt{127.0.0.255} (it goes well also outside to all other
systems in Raspberry Pi's network, no worries).

    \begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{signalkin_udp-nmea-plugin_config.png}
\caption{signalkin\_udp-nmea-plugin\_config.png}
\end{figure}

    On your local instance of OpenCPN (\emph{i.e.} on the same machine where
the Signal K node server is running) you can use broadcast client
address \texttt{127.0.0.255} - in case you change networks this address
remains unchanged. You can also use \texttt{0.0.0.255} which works as
well, but both needs the port number to be same as above.

    \begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{signalkin_udp-nmea-o-config-local.png}
\caption{signalkin\_udp-nmea-o-config-local.png}
\end{figure}

    Elsewhere in the network you would need to provide the network's
address.

    \begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{signalkin_udp-nmea-o-config-remotes.png}
\caption{signalkin\_udp-nmea-o-config-remotes.png}
\end{figure}

    

    Your all set!

    Actually, everything works as before and so smoothly that why would you
continue from here?

    If you are not interested in increased speed, less data jitter, accurate
timestamps and NMEA-2000 sourced data, you can indeed stop here.
Congratulations, you have already made an important step, please
continue to learn more about Signal K and come back here when you feel
so!

    Since now we are going to by-pass all that with \emph{DashT} plug-in's
Signal K input streamer!

    \hypertarget{enabling-and-configuring-signal-k-input-streamer}{%
\subsection{Enabling and configuring Signal K input
streamer}\label{enabling-and-configuring-signal-k-input-streamer}}

    Start your OpenCPN v5 with \emph{DashT}.

    Open the Preferences dialog and create a new instrument panel with a
single instrument in it: \emph{Signal K In}:

    \begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{signalkin-addparserinstrument.png}
\caption{signalkin-addparserinstrument.png}
\end{figure}

    The Signal K In instrument is showing the state of the connection,
normally attempting to connect to Signal K node server's delta format
output channel, indicated with the arrow moving from right to left:

    \begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{signalkin-waitingconnection.png}
\caption{signalkin-waitingconnection.png}
\end{figure}

    Once the connection is made, there is an intermediate illustration
(which normally does no last for long) indicating that the connection
has been made and heartbeat is found. Data is already flowing in.

    \begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{signalkin_heartbeat.png}
\caption{signalkin\_heartbeat.png}
\end{figure}

    Within approximately five seconds the display starts to indicate the
Signal K input streamer's throughput in OpenCPN Dashboard sentences
parsed in second.

    \begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{signalkin-streamin.png}
\caption{signalkin-streamin.png}
\end{figure}

    Please note that this value is approximately twice the value the Signal
K node server indicates. This is because one delta sentence it puts out
contains usually more than one OpenCPN Dashboard's internal sentences.
For example, \texttt{latitude} and \texttt{longitude} is one data set in
Signal K while in OpenCPN's Dashboard type of instruments we are using
it is actually two, separate data.

    \hypertarget{using-data-coming-in-signal-k-format-but-unknown-to-opencpn}{%
\subsection{Using data coming in Signal K format but unknown to
OpenCPN}\label{using-data-coming-in-signal-k-format-but-unknown-to-opencpn}}

    The above data throughput counter indicates the amount of data received
from the Signal K node server's delta channel. Every data set is parsed
and effectively passed to OpenCPN and its Dashboard instruments and
Tactics plug-in performance functions.

    But not all parsed data is necessarily used: the input data stream in
Signal K delta format can contain much more information than Dashboard
and Tactics are aware of. For example, if you have some extra boards on
your Raspberry Pi or your boat's instrumentation bus is
\textbf{NMEA-2000} instead of NMEA-0183, you will get information which
you can visualize with the Signal K's ecosystem.

    Nothing prevents \emph{DashT} to make use of the extra data and provide
enhanced instruments for energy and for engine monitoring.

    Version v1.5.11 of \emph{DashT} makes a proof of concept for this by
providing three instruments to monitor the port side engine, \emph{i.e.}
the main engine as it appears in NMEA-2000 originated data.

    \begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{signalkin-enginedata.png}
\caption{signalkin-enginedata.png}
\end{figure}

    The above use case illustrates well the achieved goal: While the main
motivation for the \emph{DashT} plug-in's Signal K by-passing input
streamer is in the overall system performance, the secondary requirement
to be NMEA-2000 compatible has also been met, opening possibilities for
enhancement requests in the future versions - albeit the Tactics part of
Dashboard-Tactis plug-in is made for \emph{voileux} this connector is
available for everybody. Sharpen your \emph{C++} pencils and jump
on-board, Dashboard's dial gauge classes are waiting for you and your
engine data!

    This would, hopefully lead to a development of \emph{DashE} where
\texttt{E} stands for Energy or Engine, according your inspiration
towards the version 2 of \emph{DashT}.

    \hypertarget{debugging}{%
\subsection{Debugging}\label{debugging}}

    \hypertarget{configuration-file-and-its-usage-in-debugging}{%
\subsubsection{Configuration file and its usage in
debugging}\label{configuration-file-and-its-usage-in-debugging}}

    The default configuration file is in JSON-format (like Signal K data).
The default values are good for normal, local-only operation. It may
require changes in case when things are not working. It is located:

    Windows
\texttt{\textbackslash{}ProgramData\textbackslash{}opencpn\textbackslash{}plugins\textbackslash{}dashoard\_tactics\_pi\textbackslash{}streamin-sk.json}

    Linux
\texttt{\textasciitilde{}/.opencpnplugins/dashboard\_tactics\_pi/streamin-sk.json}

    \begin{quote}
The configuration file is read only in startup so you would need to
restart OpenCPN after modifying this file.
\end{quote}

    When debugging you would set the verbosity parameter to a value between
\texttt{2}\ldots{} \texttt{5}, the \texttt{5} being really verbose; so
talkative that it would actually affect the performance and the OpenCPN
log file will get really big, really fast.

    Typically, you would stop OpenCPN, set the debug value and, before
starting OpenCPN you would set a line-by line observation to its log
file. With \texttt{grep} command you can further reduce the filtering if
it is too verbose.

    On Windows using PowerShell:

\begin{verbatim}
PS C:\ProgramData\opencpn>
Get-Content ./opencpn.log -Wait -Tail 20
\end{verbatim}

    On *nix systems:

\begin{verbatim}
tail -f ~.opencpn/opencpn.log
\end{verbatim}

or with filtering

\begin{verbatim}
tail -f ~.opencpn/opencpn.log | grep dashboard_tactics_pi
\end{verbatim}

    \hypertarget{no-connection-gets-established}{%
\subsubsection{No connection gets
established}\label{no-connection-gets-established}}

    If the arrows keep on moving for ever from right to left, it indicates
that the TCP/IP cannot get connection. Check the configuration file's
parameter, which is by default:

    \texttt{"source"\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ :\ "localhost:8375",\ //\ not\ limited\ to\ localhost}

    If your Signal K node server is located in another computer, replace the
\texttt{localhost} with the computer's name or if that does not work,
with its IP-address (numerical).

    if the remote Signal K server is still not answering it may be that it
does not implement the delta service in the port \texttt{8375}, or in
any other port perhaps; it is not a mandatory requirement for a Signal K
server to provide this service.

    If you know that the local Signal K node server is there, that it is
based on Node.js and it is equal of greater to version 1.17, there is
indeed no reason why the port \texttt{8375} would not be served. In this
case you may try simply to use IP-address \texttt{127.0.0.1} instead of
\texttt{loccalhost}, maybe there is an issue with your systems' Domain
Name Service (DNS).

    \hypertarget{connection-gets-established-by-no-data-is-coming-in}{%
\subsubsection{Connection gets established by no data is coming
in}\label{connection-gets-established-by-no-data-is-coming-in}}

    This is indicated by the following condition in the throughput display:

    \begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{signalkin_connectionnodata.png}
\caption{signalkin\_connectionnodata.png}
\end{figure}

    First, see the Signal K node server's dashboard and verify that it gets
indeed some data in - if not, nothing will come out, of course.

    If all looks good both for Signal K node server's input and also the
Dashboard's instruments keep hopping around as they normally do, there
is simply no data in \texttt{8375} port. See above, that's not a
mandatory requirement for a Signal K server, maybe you are using some
commercial implementation of it?

    \hypertarget{the-signal-k-stream-in-indicates-halt-state}{%
\subsubsection{The Signal K Stream In indicates HALT
state}\label{the-signal-k-stream-in-indicates-halt-state}}

    \begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{signalkin-halt.png}
\caption{signalkin-halt.png}
\end{figure}

    The message indicates that the continously running communication thread
has been stopped. There is no other remedy for this condition but to
stop gracefully OpenCPN and restart it.

    To avoid this to happen one should keep both the Signal K input stream
\emph{instrument} and the Influx DB output stream \emph{instrument} both
in their own, distinct instrument windows. In other words, they shall be
separated from other instruments but also from each other. This is to
avoid that the communication thread would get orphan when instrument
windows get reorganized.
