\section{Developer's guide to DashT wxWebView based
instruments}\label{developers-guide-to-dasht-wxwebview-based-instruments}}

    All the suffering started from this unfortunate question: what in the
earth can we do with this? :

\begin{verbatim}
    wxWebView           *m_pWebPanel;
\end{verbatim}

    \hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

    The requirement to be able to show engine and energy system data on Dash
came first into mind where a browser techniques could be useful and fast
(or slow) enough for that type of data. The usage of web techniques
would allow to jail break from wxWidget's bit aging GUI and move to the
other end of the GUI development paradigm, \emph{i.e.} no limits! After
short R\&D prototyping and proof-of-concept the limitations of the
run-time environment became known as well as the potential communication
issues. Robustness and simplicity was put in front and a bit old
fashioned web techniques were used because of the simple fact that the
wxWebView itself and the back-ends it is using are not necessarily even
from this decade!

    More modern Signal K data format and especially one of the
implementations for it, Signal K server node were chosen to provide the
data for the instruments running on a wxWebView platform. In order to
avoid multitude of network connections, DashT's Signal K streamer was
chosen to feed the instruments by subscription and by a C++ call-back
function. That is definitely a modern touch while it allows both to
limit number of network connections towards the Signal K server node
(which has certainly no problem to deal with those even if that would
have been the case, it looks to me) and to continue to feed Tactics
derived active calculations instruments from the same source of data.

    \hypertarget{scope}{%
\section{Scope}\label{scope}}

    Scope is in data which is originating from NMEA-2000 data bus.

Excluded data sources are NMEA-2000 navigational information, NMEA-2000
status information, NMEA-0183 all, IoT, GPIO and Bluetooth LE.

Data type scope is in data which can be presented as floating number, in
scientific exponential format when converted to string format.

Excluded data type are that of string type of status and other messages
and binary status bits (0/1).

    \hypertarget{plug-in-framework-services}{%
\subsubsection{Plug-in framework
services}\label{plug-in-framework-services}}

    There are many issues with various configurations present in selected
targets. It is clear that preferred protocol would be \emph{http://} or
even \emph{https://}, but if \emph{file://} is to be used because people
do not want to use a HTTP server or they do not know how to set it up,
the limitations and somewhat erratic way of interpreting the RFCs of the
various backends is causing serious issues, now and certainly in the
future!

\begin{quote}
Some catastrophe scenarios could be, for example: Windows dropping IE
being available for back-end, cf.~note(1); Linux moving a the same time
to wxWidgets 3.1 (which is good) but also to WebKit 2.x; there must be
others threads\ldots{}
\end{quote}

Result observed without no tweaking in the policies of the
out-of-the-box installation:

Where there is no issues to obtain persistency when the protocol is
\emph{http://} it looks like that one needs to use cookies in Windows
and \emph{localStorage()} elsewhere with \emph{file://} protocol. For
Mac, we do not know enough yet. This, of course is a bit shaky for the
future, even if it works now. It is better to make a parameter storage
which automatically adapts ot use \emph{localStorage()} if it is
available. This way, plan B can be that people just install that HTTP
server and they get the persistent parameters back in case there is an
issue with their back-end, which can change.

\begin{quote}
Of course, one can imagine to integrate some
\href{https://dev.to/rumkin/how-to-create-js-webserver-without-node-js-1hic}{hefty
javascript code} to make a standalone server \emph{and} the page, but it
seems, for now, overkilling. Let's start with \emph{file://}, plan B
being using \emph{http://} with an external HTTP server and, finally,
plan C being to use a local configuration file for static configuration.
\end{quote}

    Managing the above diversity is the main burden in this project and the
risk taking should be minimized by selecting only solutions and
techniques which are several years old (seeing the back-ends on each
supported system). Even then, every implementation needs to be quickly
tested on both supported priority platforms, Windows and Linux.

    The resulting instrument shall be tightly integrated in the
Dashboard-Tactics plug-in, albeit it has dependencies on one new
external data system, Signal K server node for this particular
implementation.

    Therefore the instrument's functions shall be fulfilled by a hybrid
methods: C++ for functions and call-backs for the Dashboard-Tactics
plug-in integration and for performance, HTML/JavaScript to provide the
GUI functions of the particular, developed instrument.

    You may have your own cloud based favorite to develop your HTML/CSS/JS

of course, and can be forked. Do not hesitate to browse the featured

    Of course, if you are more discrete and/or hate the cloud, you can use

    Using modern browser's \texttt{Ctrl+Shift+I} which opens the integrated
tools for the web developers remains the ideal tool to debug your
HTML/CSS/JS application. Nothing beats the possibility to set
breakpoints, study the document structure, and to see what CSS sentences
are, actually ignored by the browser and which one are doing what you
expected them to do.

    Because the ``\emph{browser}'' compatibility - or rather the
incompatibility is a real issue in this development, you can see that
the \texttt{onload} event handler takes the usage of the
\texttt{CSS.support()} function - when it is available! (Which we first
need to detect.)

on \texttt{wxWidgets} \texttt{WebView} on WebKit/IE back-end?

    It is a good idea to keep open and \textbf{regularly} reload your
project on the \texttt{WebView} based simple browser, called -
surprisingly - \textbf{\emph{webview}}. If that browser is located on
the most modest of the targeted platforms, like Raspberry Pi, that's
even better.

    \texttt{git} under different systems may change the encoding which can
create an issue in the following case:

    \begin{quote}
Special characters as symbols must match the target systems - Javascript
does not particularly know about the UTF-8, it just puts out the
characters to the browser. For example, degree character ° in
\texttt{common.js} is nerve-racking! This is how I managed to get it
work in \texttt{justgage} \texttt{symbol} character: I used
\texttt{emacs} on a Linux machine and entered the character with
\texttt{C-x\ 8\ RET\ B0\ RET} which enters an UTF-8 encoded character.
Tested OK. Now, syncing the Windows machine with GitHub Desktop.
Surprise, the file is now encoded ANSI - one can verify this with
\texttt{Notepad++} and the degree sign looks funny. \textbf{Do not touch
it!}. As such, it actually works in IE based WebKit backend. You can
test it with IE and it works both in \texttt{justgage} but also in the
plain HTML (\emph{i.e.} ``simple'') display.

    \hypertarget{performance-issues}{%
\subsection{Performance issues}\label{performance-issues}}

    Executing in a tight loop scripts on multiple windows soon brings up the
CPU load!

    Tools to observe this are the usual process tools, in Windows
\texttt{procexp.exe} and on Linux \texttt{htop}

    Small things to details can make a big difference! In the design
paradigm we expect the data coming from engine, not from wind vane, for
example. The CPU load should be not big since the dial is not moving so
often, like the wind direction dial which is jumping back and forth. But
we should not send the useless data to the dial: if it has the value, do
not use heavy script execution to send the same value again! Remember,
we do not send float values but strings. We make sure that we do not
have more than one decimal. And if the value is the same, do not send it
to the instrument!

    The below process image details is from Windows when there is no
filtering of repetitive data with twelve (12!) JS instruments, fed by
the NMEA Simulator via Signal K delta channels via Signal K input
streamer about 130 floats per second but with static data set (the peaks
are InfluxDB Out flusing to a file):

    \includegraphics{2020-01-20_dgb_procexp_12_instrucjs_clients_alpha_01.png}
\href{img/2020-01-20_dgb_procexp_12_instrucjs_clients_alpha_01.png}{(zoom)}

    That is huge waste of the CPU power since the dials are not moving at
all. Let's make the following change in the script sending code and then
observe again:

\begin{verbatim}
        if ( m_istate == JSI_SHOWDATA ) {
            if ( m_data != m_lastdataout ) {
                wxString javascript =
                    wxString::Format(
                        L"%s%s%s",
                        "window.iface.newdata(",
                        m_data,
                        ");");
                RunScript( javascript );
                m_lastdataout = m_data;
            } // then do not load the system with the same script execution multiple times
        } // the instrument is ready for data
\end{verbatim}

    \includegraphics{2020-01-20_dgb_procexp_12_instrucjs_clients_alpha_02.png}
\href{img/2020-01-20_dgb_procexp_12_instrucjs_clients_alpha_02.png}{(zoom)}

    The CPU-load looks quite reasonable around 7 percent w/ i7 CPU and the
number of I/O operations is less than half of what it used to be!

    Of course, when one creates heavy oscillation in the r.p.m. values, for
example, the CPU load goes up, since the SVG-rendering of several dials
in this case is entering into the game - there is always a price to pay
for jumping dials! But it is noteworthy that the number of I/O
operations remain low, nevertheless.

    \includegraphics{2020-01-20_dgb_procexp_12_instrucjs_clients_alpha_02_cont_changes.png}
\href{img/2020-01-20_dgb_procexp_12_instrucjs_clients_alpha_02_cont_changes.png}{(zoom)}

    The background load can be further reduced by \textbf{randomizing the
threads} which are driving the JS instruments:

    \includegraphics{2020-01-22_dgb_procexp_12_instrucjs_clients_alpha_02_randomized_threads.png}
\href{img/2020-01-22_dgb_procexp_12_instrucjs_clients_alpha_02_randomized_threads.png}{(zoom)}

    \hypertarget{overall-performance-in-hosting-systems}{%
\subsection{Overall performance in hosting
system(s)}\label{overall-performance-in-hosting-systems}}

    The paradigm of subscription of the JS instruments into the single
datasource which is provided by the \texttt{streamin-sk.cpp} is
efficient by the speed of tha call-backs and their little overhead. It
also limits the number of connections to the Signal K server node.

    The subscription paradigm probably (but not necessarily) needs to be
expanded to that steamer/parser itself. Starting from \emph{SignalK
server node v1.19.0} the subscription policy is made mandatory also for
the TCP socket data read. This can be used to our advantage regarding
the CPU load. The streamer is centralizing the data connection which is
good, but once we have set up of what we need to subscribe for, we could
reduce the CPU load of that streamer by asking it to subscribe only for
the values we are interested in.

    With NMEA Simulator we can reach quite considerable amount of messages,
which leads the \texttt{streamin-sk.cpp} thread to process about 290 -
300 floats per second resulting about 10 - 12 \% of constant CPU load
(Win20/i7), at the same time \texttt{npm} process, hosting the Signal K
server node has 7 - 8 \% CPU load.

    \includegraphics{2020-02-09_dgb_procexp_01_instrucjs_clients_alpha_02_sk1-21-0_max_nof_NMEA-2000_msgs.png}

    There is no doubt that the network distributed data producing and
consuming is a better configuration scheme: the Signal K server on a RPI
and the data consumer on another computer, like on Windows laptop or a

being a Windows program) but it shows the idea of consuming one CPU core
on a RPI 4 for communication tasks:

\section{Help! My fancy application looks rotten / does not work on
RPI}\label{help-my-fancy-application-looks-rotten-does-not-work-on-rpi}}

    Let's consider our design constraints first: we are developing for
cross-platform, limited or old-fashioned web application run-time
support environment with very small screen or canvas area.

    Sounds familiar? Yes, it is like developing a HTML/CSS/JS application
for a telephone back in the day!

    You need to have the patience - and more importantly - the possibility
to carefully check and adjust at pixel level CSS files and debug
stubborningly failing JavaScript which worked fine on your browser.

    Unfortunately the \emph{iOS} or \emph{Android} USB-based development
tool connections to your \emph{Safari} or \emph{Chrome} will not be any
good in this case.

    There is, however a solution. It is not developed any more (since 2017)
but it still exists and \textbf{it still works}:
\href{https://people.apache.org/~pmuellr/weinre/docs/latest/}{WEINRE}.
Let's hope it is not going away, or that other tools for
\texttt{wxWidgets} \texttt{WebView} would emerge!

    \begin{quote}
\textbf{Attention vulnerabilities} - \emph{weinre} module has its
development stopped and it is as such a very vulnerable product. Use
\texttt{npm\ audit} to see the details of those. Make sure to use
--save-dev switch when installing to use it only for occasional
debugging during the development phase.
\end{quote}

    While waiting the new tools, I archived
\href{pdf/debugging_mobile_javascript_with_WEINRE_ibm_blog_2011.pdf}{this
paper}
(\href{https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/94e7fded-7162-445e-8ceb-97a2140866a9/entry/debugging_mobile_javascript_with_weinre?lang=en}{2011})
which nicely explains the remote portable device debugging concept and
what you can expect and what you cannot expect from WEINRE.

    \hypertarget{installating-weinre-on-rpi}{%
\subsection{Installating WEINRE on
RPI}\label{installating-weinre-on-rpi}}

    To use WEINRE, one needs to have web server. Luckily, on RPI this is
easy:

    Installing http-server on RPI

    If you are reading this, it is highly likely that you are using the
excellent
\href{https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/master/raspberry_pi_installation.md}{SignalK
node server} on your RPI. That means that you have \texttt{node.js} and,
with it \texttt{npm} package manager.

    Install \href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server}{http-server}
with command \texttt{sudo\ npm\ install\ http-server\ -g}.

    Using the command line, move to the directory where your application
file root is located and give command \texttt{http-server}. Leave it
running \emph{et voilà}, you have a web server!

    \hypertarget{get-weinre}{%
\subsubsection{Get WEINRE}\label{get-weinre}}

    \texttt{sudo\ npm\ intall\ -\/-save-dev\ weinre}

    \hypertarget{configuring-weinre}{%
\subsubsection{Configuring WEINRE}\label{configuring-weinre}}

    In your home folder, create a file
\texttt{\textasciitilde{}/.weinre/server.properties} with the following
contents:

    \begin{verbatim}
boundHost:    -all-
httpPort:     8081
reuseAddr:    true
readTimeout:  1
deathTimeout: 5
\end{verbatim}

    \hypertarget{launching-weinre-server}{%
\subsubsection{Launching WEINRE server}\label{launching-weinre-server}}

    Using (another shell) command line, type \texttt{weinre} and leave it
running.

    Now you should have two servers, \texttt{http-server} and
\texttt{weinre} running.

    \hypertarget{opening-the-weinre-debugger}{%
\subsubsection{Opening the WEINRE
debugger}\label{opening-the-weinre-debugger}}

    Start the RPI's browser, probably \emph{Chromium} (but I am using
\emph{Vivaldi}) and navigate to \texttt{localhost:8081}.

    The server's welcome page, \emph{weinre - web inspector remote} will
open. It will give you interesting information and even demos you may
want to try first opening them on a \textbf{separate} screen or tab.

    Likewise, you would open the debugger service,
\texttt{localhost:8081/client/\#anonymous} on a separate screen or tab.
This window is now waiting for a connection from your remote (or local)
\texttt{wxWidgets} \texttt{WebView} based application.

    \hypertarget{preparing-your-application-for-remote-debugging}{%
\subsubsection{Preparing your application for remote
debugging}\label{preparing-your-application-for-remote-debugging}}

    With ``\emph{remote}'' we understand your debug server running on the
Raspberry Pi, and either a \emph{webview} browser or OpenCPN with its
\texttt{WebView} class based instruments running on your Windows, Mac or
Linux development system

    Of course, it is not so ``\emph{remote}'' if the main debugging target
being the \emph{webview} browser or OpenCPN running on Raspberry Pi. But
since WEINRE access event those applications through the http-server, it
does not make any difference, in fact:

    One can have multiple hosts used at the same time, for testing and
debugging the same application on different run-time platforms.

    Each instance of the application must know where WEINRE server is
located. So you need to know your Raspberry Pi's IP-address in your
network. Let's say it is 192.168.8.103 : In really ``\emph{remote}''
test environments you would add the following line in your HTML:

    \begin{verbatim}
<!--script src="http://192.168.8.103:8081/target/target-script-min.js#anonymous"></script-->
\end{verbatim}

    It is not mandatory to use it in exclusively ``\emph{local}''
development, you can set:

    \begin{verbatim}
<!--script src="http://127.0.0.1:8081/target/target-script-min.js#anonymous"></script-->
\end{verbatim}

    Open the your application's HTML-file in \emph{webview} browser - drag
and drop works.

    As you can see above, this makes the application to download a
javascript module from the WEINRE server. It connects you the WEINRE
server's debug environment. If you not see the connection under the
\emph{Remote} tab, reload the page:

    \includegraphics{2019-12-25_weinre_server_connected_to_local_host_client.png}
\href{pdf/2019-12-25_weinre_server_connected_to_local_host_client.png}{(zoom)}

    \hypertarget{debugging-with-weinre}{%
\subsubsection{Debugging with WEINRE}\label{debugging-with-weinre}}

    Please remember that this is \textbf{not} full blown JavaScript debugger
like the one which you can find from your browser. Before coming here
you have debugged your algorithms and you will use WEINRE only to find
and sort out the snagging incompatibility issues between the various
run-time environments.

    What can one do with WEINRE, then?

    \hypertarget{inspect-the-document-structure}{%
\subsubsection{Inspect the document
structure}\label{inspect-the-document-structure}}

    In the case of it is your JavaScript which dynamically constructs your
document structure contents, it would be a good omen for the rest of the
session if you can find actually the intended identifiers in the
structure:

    \includegraphics{2019-12-25_weinre_server_element_inspection.png}
\href{img/2019-12-25_weinre_server_element_inspection.png}{(zoom)}

    Like with the modern browsers, you can select a structure in the
``\emph{Elements}'' window and it will be highlighted in the
\emph{webview} browser, which is quite handy sometimes.

    ``\emph{Resources}'', ``\emph{Network}'' and ``\emph{Timeline}'' tabs
are quite useless and you should not expect to see anything interesting
there.

    ``\emph{Console}'', as the name implies allows you to inspect the
variables and show the \texttt{console.log()} output.

    \includegraphics{2019-12-25_weinre_server_consolelog_code.png}
\href{img/2019-12-25_weinre_server_consolelog_code.png}{(zoom)}

    Finally, the answer to the question ``\emph{what to do?}'' if your
screen remains blank or if the mouse event does not work as you expect
is the following: Use the good old ``\emph{comment out suspicious code
blocks until your application loads}''-method!. Then put
\texttt{console.log()} calls in critical points.

    \includegraphics{2019-12-25_weinre_server_console_mouse_event.png}
\href{img/2019-12-25_weinre_server_console_mouse_event.png}{(zoom)}

    \begin{quote}
\textbf{NOTE} An older browser with developers tools is often enough to
resolve startup problems related to typos in variable names and such
(you do not need Weinre for that). Blow the dust out from your obsolete
Internet Explorer and hit key \textbf{F12}!
\end{quote}

    \includegraphics{2019-12-25_weinre_server_console_mouse_event_log.png}
\href{img/2019-12-25_weinre_server_console_mouse_event_log.png}{(zoom)}

    Rudimentary? Yes, but supposing that your algorithms are already tested
elsewhere, WEINRE allows you to have the necessary tools to avoid
guesswork based development!

    \hypertarget{debugging-data}{%
\section{Debugging Data}\label{debugging-data}}

    First of all, our interface is Signal K node server which puts out
Signal K. But it does not hurt to know how does it get the data from the
NMEA-2000 bus

    \begin{quote}
Since nobody can count the number of NMEA-2000 adaptations out there, we
use the excellent
\href{https://opencpn.org/wiki/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=opencpn:supplementary_software:signalk:a6\#how_to_use_a_nmea-simulator_to_stream_nmea-0183_and_nmea-2000_data}{NMEA-0183/2000

\end{quote}

    \hypertarget{nmea-2000-data-analysis}{%
\subsection{NMEA-2000 data analysis}\label{nmea-2000-data-analysis}}

    By far the easiest way is to use the log files provided by a proven
Signal K server node device support. It is unlikely that one will find a
bug here, but it is good practice to start the signal path debugging as
close to the source as possible.

    Turn on the log file usage for the connection, let the NMEA-2000 data
flow and check the result. You should find something like this:

those. Meanwhile, in order to have an idea how the NMEA-2000 device
support of Signal K server nodes sees the data, let's study a serial
line connected NMEA-2000

    \begin{verbatim}
import serial
ser = serial.Serial('COM30')
s = ser.read(100)
print(s)
\end{verbatim}

    One gets something like this:

\begin{verbatim}
b'\xf2\x01\xff\x12\x00\x00\x00\x00\x08\x00<\x08\xd6\x02\x02\xff\xff0\x10\x03
\x10\x02\x93%\x02\x01\xf2\x01\xff\x12\x00\x00\x00\x00\x1a\x00L\nf\x0e]u2\x05
\x83\x01\x10\x10\xb4\xb5\x00\x01\x00\x1f\x00\xff\x00\x00\x00\x00C=\xb8\x10
\x03\x10\x02\x93\x13\x02\x00\xf2\x01\xff\x12\x00\x00\x00\x00\x08\x00<\x08
\xd6\x02\x02\xff\xff0\x10\x03\x10\x02\x93\x91\x06\x14\xf0\x01\xff'
\end{verbatim}

Which is not that good, since one has both hex value and - when the
interpretation is possible - ASCII values mixed.

    This should, theoretically at least, work but does not show anything,
probaly because of the protocol differences between CAN and enhancing
NMEA-2000. We keep it here in case somebody has an idea how to get it
work.

\begin{verbatim}
import can

bus = can.interface.Bus(bustype='serial', channel='COM30', bitrate=115200)
for msg in bus:
    print(msg)
\end{verbatim}

    One can find attempts to print structured data without the aboev class,
but they are not apated to NMEA-2000:

    \begin{verbatim}
import serial
import struct

ser = serial.Serial('COM30')

fmt = "<IB3x8s"

while True:
   can_pkt = ser.read(16)
   can_id, length, data = struct.unpack(fmt, can_pkt)
   data = data[:length]
   print(data, can_id , can_pkt)
\end{verbatim}

    We get something like this:

\begin{verbatim}
b'\xff\x12' 328401424 b'\x10\x02\x93\x13\x02\x00\xf2\x01\xff\x12\x00\x00\x00\x00\x10\x02'
b'\x00\x00\x00\x00\x86\x14\x05\x9a' 335974803 b'\x93\x91\x06\x14\xf0\x01\xff\x12\x00\x00\x00\x00\x86\x14\x05\x9a'
b'0 simula' 1162694146 b'\x02NMEA2000 simula'
b'ne\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00' 544370548 b'tor engine\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'
b'09\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00' 841888000
...
\end{verbatim}

    \textbf{Pure hex is the best}, finally, one can search for \texttt{F201}
which is hex signature of PGN \texttt{127489}.

    \begin{verbatim}
import serial
import struct
import binascii

ser = serial.Serial('COM30')

while True:
   can_pkt = ser.read(4)
   print(binascii.hexlify(can_pkt))
\end{verbatim}

    Now, let's look from this data, for example, PGN 127489, Field, 3:
Engine Oil Temperature.

    b'10029325' b'0201\textbf{f201}' b'ff120000' b'00001a00'
b'4c0a\textbf{660e}' b'5d753205' b'8301802e' b'b8000100' b'1f00ff00'
b'00000043'

    Yes, it is still there, value 0x0e66 (see above for the interpretation).

    I reckon that now we can just trust the Signal K driver's author what
comes to the debug printing!

    \hypertarget{observing-the-data-coming-from-signal-k-server-node-delta-channel}{%
\subsection{Observing the data coming from Signal K server node delta
channel}\label{observing-the-data-coming-from-signal-k-server-node-delta-channel}}

    Starting from v1.19.0 the TCP delta channel requires also subscription
without exception. Good for the standard and overall charge of the
server but bad for debugging with an standard browser. One needs to be
able to send the subscription in non-human readable JSON-format and -
strangely - no headers are accepted before that, only the JSON
structure! That makes the usage of the developer tools a bit awkward in
the browser since how to compose such a message using the developer
tools?

    In case you manage to get the Signal K input streamer streaming
something (by default, it asks for everything), you can increase its
debug level in its JSON-configuration file \textbf{above reasonable}
(\emph{the thread will fail in its real-time parsing job because it
needs to interrupt its running to call for the log file writing from the
plugin process, also the log-file gets really quick really full, be
warned}):

    From \texttt{streamin-sk.cpp}:

\begin{verbatim}
if ( m_verbosity > 5 ) {
   m_threadMsg = wxString::Format(
      "dashboard_tactics_pi: Signal K type (%s) sentence (%s) talker (%s) "
       "src (%s) pgn (%d) timestamp (%s) path (%s) value (%f), valStr (%s)",
       type, sentence, talker, src, pgn, timestamp, path, value, valStr);
       wxQueueEvent( m_frame, event.Clone() );
} // then slowing down seriously with the indirect debug log
\end{verbatim}

    From \texttt{streamin-sk.json} (in data directory):

\begin{verbatim}
"streaminsk" : {
   "source"          : "localhost:8375", // not limited to localhost
   "api"             : "v1.19.0",        // version of Signal K server
   "connectionretry" : 5,                // [s] (min.=1s to reduce CPU load)
   "timestamps"      : "server",         // Signal K "server" or "local"
   "verbosity"       : 6                 //0=no,1=events,2=verbose,3+=debug
\end{verbatim}

    You will be well served:

    \begin{verbatim}

    \hypertarget{c-debugging-for-the-subscribed-value}{%
\subsection{C++ debugging for the subscribed
value}\label{c-debugging-for-the-subscribed-value}}

    \begin{quote}
The key point is to have only \textbf{one} \emph{instrujs} instrument
subcribed to data under inspection, in our example the
\texttt{propulsion.port.temperature} path. Please remind that we have
C++ object, subscription based data - it s getting pretty complex pretty
quickly from the debugging point of view!
\end{quote}

    With your (single) subcribed instrument active and working and hopefully
even showing some value, put your breakpoint here in
\texttt{instrujs.cpp}:

    \begin{verbatim}
void InstruJS::PushData(double data, wxString unit, long long timestamp)
{
    if ( !std::isnan(data) ) {
        setTimestamp( timestamp );  // Triggers also base class' watchdog
...        
\end{verbatim}

    Using the above, example debugging data, you should see the same value,
\emph{i.e.} 300.45.

    \hypertarget{javascript-data-debugging}{%
\subsection{Javascript data debugging}\label{javascript-data-debugging}}

    For performance reasons, \texttt{data.js} is not constantly printing
debug information to the \texttt{console.log()}. But nothing prevents
you to add such a statement in there. But since you will be running
within the OpenCPN, you would probably need to use \texttt{weinre}-tool
as discussed above to see the log output.

    Instead, I have used slow but more verbose method of using a browser and
its developer's tools. On can give the same commands through the
window.iface.* methods than the \texttt{instrujs.cpp} is doing (much
faster). With few such commands (with fake ID string but keep it always
the same, like \texttt{555-666} to profit the persistence), one can then
issue \texttt{iface.newdata()} commands.
